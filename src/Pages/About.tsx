                    <p>
                        Hey there! I'm GÃ©nesis, a freelance Software Developer who loves building cool stuff from the ground up. I'm passionate about crafting products that make a difference. My journey started in 2014 as a UX/UI designer. I've always been drawn to making things look and feel great. This experience gave me a unique perspective on how to bridge the gap between design and technology. I also worked with global clients to deliver automation solutions, which taught me how to align technology with business goals.
                    </p>
                    <p> What really sparked my interest was the magic behind how things work. So, in 2024, I dove headfirst into coding. It was love at first sight! I'm now a web development enthusiast, with a focus on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, React, and Next.js.</p>
                    <p>I get a real kick out of solving problems, and I love that I can combine my UX/UI background with my engineering skills to build products that are ready for the real world.</p>

                    <p>Back in 2014, I went back to my hometown to be part of a startup with some friends. We built the first MVP for YUMMY_club (now Yummy) in Venezuela. It was a wild ride, full of learning curves and late nights, but I wouldn't trade it for anything!</p>

                <div>
                    <h1>Migration</h1>
                    <p>Then, in 2017, I decided to move to Spain, where I embraced new opportunities. Later, I decided to take a leap of faith and opened a restaurant, talk about a crash course in business! Two years after that, I moved to Barcelona, where I've been working as a designer.</p>
                </div>
                <div><h1>So yeah...</h1>
                    <p> My journey hasn't always been a straight line, but it's made me who I am. I'm adaptable, I love to learn, and I'm not afraid of a challenge. I bring that same energy and enthusiasm to every project I work on.</p></div>
