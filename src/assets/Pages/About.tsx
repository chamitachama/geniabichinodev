                        My name is Génesis, I'm currently working as a freelance Sofware developer where I'm building products since the early stages. I transitioned into engineering after having the need to build my own tools for a diverse personal projects I'm currently developing.
                        I started learning to code in 2024 out of curiosity and soon felt in love with the posibilities, and also wanting to have a deeper understanding of how things in tech were built.
                    </p>
                    <p> After a few months of learning, I knew that I want to become a full-time software engineer.</p>
                    <p>I have been focusing on web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, React, Next.js</p>
                    <p>I love solving problems and as an engineer but also as a former UX / UI designer, I'm able to combine both stacks to build production ready products</p>

                    <p>My journey in tech began as a UX/UI designer. I've always been drawn to aesthetics and well-crafted products, so moving from print design to web and app design felt like a natural evolution. And While I learned a lot during my time working with development teams across the world. I often felt there was something missing a gap between design and technology that I wanted to bridge. I was fascinated by how the tech teams brought ideas to life. Over time, I realized what truly excites me is the underlying structure and logic that makes everything work.</p>

                    <h1>Migration</h1>
                    <p>In 2014 I moved back to my home town to be part of startup at the age of 21 with a group of friends during those years we developed the first MVP to YUMMY_club (now Yummy back in Venezuela) while I’ve worked with global clients to deliver automation solutions aligned with their business goals. But the Crisis hit hard and I took the oppotunity to migrate when money was evaporting because of inflation</p>
