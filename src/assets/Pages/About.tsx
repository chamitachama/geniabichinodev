                    <p>
                        I'm currently working as a freelance Sofware developer where I'm building products since the early stages, I transitioned into engineering after having the need to build my own tools for a diverse personal projects I'm currently developing.
                        I started learning to code in 2024 out of curiosity and soon felt in love with the posibilities, and also wanting to have a deeper understanding of how things in tech were built. 
                    </p>
                    <p> After a few months of learning, I knew that I want to become a full-time software engineer.</p>
                    <p>I have been focusing on web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, React, Next.js</p>
                    <p>I love solving problems and as an engineer but also as a former UX / UI designer, I'm able to combine both stacks to build production ready products</p>
